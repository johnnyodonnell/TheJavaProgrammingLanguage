From p. 464

"""
A design that uses reference queues can be more reliable than direct use of
finalization - particularly with phantom references - but remember that there
are no guarantees as to exactly when or in what order a reference object will
be enqueued.
"""

So then why is a design that uses reference queues more reliable than direct
use of finalization?

This book isn't very popular, so I doubt this type of question would get
much attention on StackOverflow.
